# Waseda University third-year class, Information Science and Engineering experiment project

Making Java-based communication app. I was in charge of the front end.

This is the front-end implementation only.

Please Note:
This repository contains the frontend source code and requires a corresponding backend application to be fully functional. Therefore, the live deployment will not work as expected.

Finished product(private repository)
